# AI Vision Lab - Image Recognition System

AI Vision Lab is a modern web application that uses machine learning to recognize objects in images. The system features a sleek, responsive interface with both light and dark modes, and provides detailed recognition results with confidence scores.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Image Recognition**: Utilizes MobileNetV2 for fast and accurate image classification
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with animations and visual feedback
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark themes for comfortable viewing
- **Multiple Predictions**: Shows primary match and alternative possibilities
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy image uploading with drag and drop functionality
- **MongoDB Storage**: Saves images and predictions for future reference

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **AI Model**: TensorFlow with MobileNetV2
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-vision-lab.git
   cd ai-vision-lab
   ```

2. Set up the Python virtual environment
   ```bash
   cd backend/flask
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start MongoDB
   ```bash
   # Start MongoDB service using your system's service manager
   # For example, on macOS with Homebrew:
   brew services start mongodb-community
   ```

4. Run the Flask application
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application
